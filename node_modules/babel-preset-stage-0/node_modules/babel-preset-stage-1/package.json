Either the champion or a co-champion must be a member of TC39 (source). The problem solved by the proposal must be described in prose. The solution must be described via examples, an API and a discussion of semantics and algorithms. Lastly, potential obstacles for the proposal must be identified, such as interactions with other features and implementation challenges. Implementation-wise, polyfills and demos are needed.\n>\n> **What’s next?** By accepting a proposal for stage 1, TC39 declares its willingness to examine, discuss and contribute to the proposal. Going forward, major changes to the proposal are expected\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-preset-stage-1\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)\n\n**.babelrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"stage-1\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel script.js --presets stage-1\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  presets: [\"stage-1\"]\n});\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Chapter \"[The TC39 process for ECMAScript features](http://exploringjs.com/es2016-es2017/ch_tc39-process.html)\" in \"Exploring ES2016 and ES2017\" by Axel Rauschmayer\n",
